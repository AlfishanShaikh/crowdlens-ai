## 🚀 Introduction

**CrowdLens AI** is a **prototype** real-time, AI-powered civic issue reporting assistant.  
It demonstrates how citizens can report problems in their surroundings with just a **single photo**, turning civic engagement into a seamless experience.  

From potholes and broken streetlights to garbage overflow and water leaks, CrowdLens AI automates the **entire process of reporting civic issues** — making cities smarter, safer, and cleaner.

---

## 🏙 Problem Statement

Urban residents often face challenges like:

- Potholes on roads  
- Broken streetlights  
- Water leakages  
- Overflowing garbage  

Currently, reporting these issues to municipal bodies is **manual and time-consuming**:
- Finding the right authority’s contact.  
- Filling out long complaint forms.  
- Waiting without status updates.  

👉 As a result, **most problems remain unreported**, leading to unsafe, unhygienic, and unpleasant public spaces.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

CrowdLens AI (Prototype) shows how a **photo** can be transformed into a structured complaint:

1. **Detects the issue type** (trash, pothole, broken light, etc.) using AI vision models.  
2. **Captures GPS location automatically** — no typing required.  
3. **Generates an official complaint** with all necessary details.  
4. **Sends it to the correct municipal department** via pre-integrated channels.  
5. **Tracks complaint status** and notifies the user in real-time.

## 🤖 Role of Agentic AI (via qRaptor)

The backbone of CrowdLens AI is powered by **qRaptor’s Agentic AI framework**, which coordinates multiple AI agents:

- **Image Analysis Agent** → Detects issue category & severity.  
- **Geo-Context Agent** → Maps GPS to administrative zones.  
- **Complaint Drafting Agent** → Auto-formats reports for local authorities.  
- **Notification Agent** → Sends updates & confirmations.  
- **Orchestration Layer** → Links image → location → report → submission → notification without manual effort.  

✅ Thanks to **qRaptor AI**, even as a prototype, CrowdLens demonstrates the power of multi-agent systems for civic reporting.

## 🔑 Key Features

- 📸 **One-Tap Civic Reporting** → Just take a photo, everything else is automated.  
- 🧠 **AI Issue Detection** → Identifies type & urgency of civic problems.  
- 📍 **Auto Location Mapping** → Detects GPS and maps address automatically.  
- 📤 **Instant Official Submission** → Sends directly to the right department.  
- 📊 **Status Tracking Dashboard** → Citizens can track complaint progress.  
- 🌍 **Community Impact View (Optional)** → Shows issues on a map to encourage collective action.

## 🎯 Expected Impact

**For Citizens** → Easy, transparent, and quick civic reporting.  
**For Municipal Bodies** → Structured, geotagged reports that save time and speed up resolutions.  
**For Communities** → Better living conditions, collective responsibility, and cleaner neighborhoods.  

🔮 **Scalability** → Can expand into rural areas, disaster management, and environmental hazard reporting.  

⚡ Note: This is currently a **prototype** showcasing the concept. A full production system would include government integrations, advanced AI training, and stronger security.

## 📌 How CrowdLens AI Works

1. User snaps a **photo** of the civic issue.  
2. **AI Vision Agent** identifies the problem type.  
3. **Geo-Tagging Agent** maps exact location.  
4. **Complaint Drafting Agent** creates a formatted report.  
5. **Orchestration Layer** (via qRaptor) sends it to the **right authority**.  
6. **Notification Agent** updates user with complaint status.

## 📊 System Architecture

User → Upload Photo
1. AI Vision (Issue Detection)
2. GPS Mapping (Geo-Context)
3. Report Generation (Complaint Drafting)
4. Orchestration (qRaptor AI)
5. Submission to Authorities
6. Notifications Back to User
