## üöÄ Introduction

**CrowdLens AI** is a **prototype** real-time, AI-powered civic issue reporting assistant.  
It demonstrates how citizens can report problems in their surroundings with just a **single photo**, turning civic engagement into a seamless experience.  

From potholes and broken streetlights to garbage overflow and water leaks, CrowdLens AI automates the **entire process of reporting civic issues** ‚Äî making cities smarter, safer, and cleaner.

## üèô Problem Statement

Urban residents often face challenges like:

- Potholes on roads  
- Broken streetlights  
- Water leakages  
- Overflowing garbage  

Currently, reporting these issues to municipal bodies is **manual and time-consuming**:
- Finding the right authority‚Äôs contact.  
- Filling out long complaint forms.  
- Waiting without status updates.  

üëâ As a result, **most problems remain unreported**, leading to unsafe, unhygienic, and unpleasant public spaces.

---

## üí° Solution Overview

CrowdLens AI (Prototype) shows how a **photo** can be transformed into a structured complaint:

1. **Detects the issue type** (trash, pothole, broken light, etc.) using AI vision models.  
2. **Captures GPS location automatically** ‚Äî no typing required.  
3. **Generates an official complaint** with all necessary details.  
4. **Sends it to the correct municipal department** via pre-integrated channels.  
5. **Tracks complaint status** and notifies the user in real-time.

## ü§ñ Role of Agentic AI (via qRaptor)

The backbone of CrowdLens AI is powered by **qRaptor‚Äôs Agentic AI framework**, which coordinates multiple AI agents:

- **Image Analysis Agent** ‚Üí Detects issue category & severity.  
- **Geo-Context Agent** ‚Üí Maps GPS to administrative zones.  
- **Complaint Drafting Agent** ‚Üí Auto-formats reports for local authorities.  
- **Notification Agent** ‚Üí Sends updates & confirmations.  
- **Orchestration Layer** ‚Üí Links image ‚Üí location ‚Üí report ‚Üí submission ‚Üí notification without manual effort.  

‚úÖ Thanks to **qRaptor AI**, even as a prototype, CrowdLens demonstrates the power of multi-agent systems for civic reporting.

## üìå How CrowdLens AI Works

1. User snaps a **photo** of the civic issue.  
2. **AI Vision Agent** identifies the problem type.  
3. **Geo-Tagging Agent** maps exact location.  
4. **Complaint Drafting Agent** creates a formatted report.  
5. **Orchestration Layer** (via qRaptor) sends it to the **right authority**.  
6. **Notification Agent** updates user with complaint status.  

---

## üìä System Architecture

User ‚Üí Upload Photo
1. AI Vision (Issue Detection)
2. GPS Mapping (Geo-Context)
3. Report Generation (Complaint Drafting)
4. Orchestration (qRaptor AI)
5. Submission to Authorities
6. Notifications Back to User
